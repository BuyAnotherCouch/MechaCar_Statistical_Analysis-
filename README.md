## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
For our linear regression model, we used the following hypotheses and significance level:
- H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
- Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m â‰  0
- Significance Level: 0.05

- From our analysis, we determined that the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

- Our p-value is 5.35e-11, which is significantly lower than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. This means that there is enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis and assume that the slope of the linear model is not zero.

- Our multiple r-squared value is 0.7149. This tells us that roughly 71.5% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![total_summary](/resources/total_summary.PNG)

Based on our results, we can see that the pounds per square ince (PSI) variance is 62.29, which meets design specifications.

However, when we break the results down by lot, we can see that lot 3 fails to meet design specifications, as the variance is 170.29, which is exceeds the 100 pounds per square inch limit.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

We used the following hypotheses and significance level for our t-Tests:
- H0 : There is no statistical difference between the two means.
- Ha : There is a statistical difference between the two means.
- Significance Level: 0.05

### T-Test: All Manufacturing Lots
- Our p-value is 0.06 which is higher than our significance level. Therefore our null hypothesis passes and we can conclude that the two means are similar.

### T-Test: Lot 1
- Our p-value is 1.00 which is higher than our significance level. Therefore our null hypothesis passes and we can conclude that the two means are similar.

![ttest2](/resources/ttest2.PNG)

### T-Test: Lot 2
- Our p-value is 0.61 which is higher than our significance level. Therefore our null hypothesis passes and we can conclude that the two means are similar.

### T-Test: Lot 3
- Our p-value is 0.04 which is lower than our significance level. Therefore our null hypothesis fails and we can conclude that the two means are not similar.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
One of the main metrics that would be of interest to a consumer when choosing a car is affordability, so in this study I have chosen to focus on how cost affects the consumer's decision to choose MechaCar over its competition. 

The following hypotheses and significance level will be used for our tests:
- H0 : Cost does not affect the consumer's decision to choose MechaCar over its competitors.
- Ha : Cost does affect the consumer's decision to choose MechaCar over its competitors.
- Significance level: 0.05

Since we will be analysing how cost impacts the consumer's behaviour in MechaCar's many competitors, we will need to use a statistical test that allows us to determine if there is a statistical difference in the means from multiple samples. Therefore, we will be using the ANOVA test.

To preform this test, we will need the following data:
- Cost will be our dependent, continuous variable.
- The manufacturer will be our independent, categorical variable.
- Household income will also be used as an independent, categorical variable when analysing the consumers' spending power.
